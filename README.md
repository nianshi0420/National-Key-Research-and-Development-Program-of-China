Note: The following database was developed under the National Key R&D Program of China – Rare Earth Special Project “High-Coercivity Pr/Nd-Free Rare-Earth–Cobalt-Based Permanent Magnetic Materials and Fabrication Technology” (Grant No. 2022YFB3505300) — Subproject 1: Design of Functional Building Units for Pr/Nd-Free Rare-Earth–Cobalt-Based Hard Magnetic Phases (Grant No. 2022YFB3505301).

This is a high-throughput–computed database of stable crystal structures for Sm–Co–based systems with various transition-metal dopants and structural phases. The database includes the following parameters:
Crystal structure files (.cif); Lattice constant a (Å); Cell volume V (Å³); Substitution (formation) energy Esub (eV); Magnetic moment Mₛ (μB); Saturation magnetization μ₀Mₛ (T); Magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE, meV); Magnetocrystalline anisotropy field μ₀Hₐ (T).

# database:
Screening of 17 stabilized structures in RCo5; 
Screening of 29 stabilized structures in LaCo5; 
Screening of 96 stabilized structures in SmCo5; 
Screening of 92 stabilized structures in Sm2Co17; 
Screening of 56 stabilized structures in SmCo3; 
Screening of 58 stabilized structures in Sm2Co7-H; 
Screening of 74 stabilized structures in Sm2Co7-R; 

Total of 422 stabilized structures were screened.
